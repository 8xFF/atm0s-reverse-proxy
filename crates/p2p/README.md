# P2P Network with atm0s Routing

## Description

A lightweight peer-to-peer (P2P) network utilizing the atm0s routing mechanism, built entirely with asynchronous programming and QUIC (using the quinn library). This project aims to provide a robust and efficient framework for P2P communication.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Built with async programming for high performance and scalability.
- **QUIC Protocol**: Utilizes the QUIC protocol for secure and fast data transmission.
- **atm0s Routing**: Implements the atm0s routing mechanism for efficient peer discovery and message routing.
